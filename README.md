Live demo: https://procodes27.github.io/portfolio-website/

- Project gallery with links and descriptions
- About / skills section
- Contact form (client-side or linked to an external service)
- Smooth scrolling and simple animations
- Easy customization of content and styling

## Tech / Tools
- Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (static site)
- Optional: Node.js for local development tooling (e.g., live-server)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Getting Started (Local)
To preview or develop locally you can simply open the files in your browser, or run a lightweight static server.

Option 1 — Open locally:
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/procodes27/portfolio-website.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Option 2 — Using a simple local server (recommended):
1. Install a static server if you don't have one. Example using npm:
   npm install -g live-server
2. Start the server from the project root:
   live-server

This will open a local dev server and refresh automatically on changes.

## Customization
- Update content:
  - Edit `index.html` to change text, sections, and links.
  - Update project cards to add/remove portfolio items and change their URLs.
- Update styling:
  - Modify CSS found in `css/` (or wherever styles are located).
  - Replace fonts, colors, or layout rules to match your branding.
- Update assets:
  - Put images in `assets/` or `images/` and reference them from HTML/CSS.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
This repository is already configured for GitHub Pages. To deploy updates:
1. Commit and push changes to the repository (main branch).
2. GitHub Pages will automatically build and serve from the `main` branch or the branch configured in repository settings.
3. Your site will be available at:
   https://procodes27.github.io/portfolio-website/

If you want to use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file to the repository and configure DNS on your domain provider.
