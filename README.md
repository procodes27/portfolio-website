## Preview / Local development
Option 1 — Open locally:
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/procodes27/portfolio-website.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Option 2 — Use a simple local server (recommended):
1. Install a static server (example using npm):
   npm install -g live-server
2. Start the server from the project root:
   live-server

This will open a local dev server and refresh automatically on changes.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` to change sections, text, and links.
- Update CSS files (likely in a `css/` folder) to change colors, fonts, and layout.
- Replace images in the `assets/` or `images/` folder and update references.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
This repository is configured to serve a static site via GitHub Pages.
- Push changes to the `main` branch (or the branch configured in repository settings).
- The site will be available at: https://procodes27.github.io/portfolio-website/

To use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with your domain and update DNS records with your registrar.
